#### General
There are some cases that have no clear goal, or do not belong to a specific process.
Some examples are shown below.

We have several channels directly into Slack, where service owners need help with various issues concerning Altinn 2.0.
- Do we need an overview of these inquiries?
- Do we need to know if they are answered or not?
- Do we need tool support for this or not?
