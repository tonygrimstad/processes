In order to get a common understanding of what is the need for tool support in the operating concept, a common understanding of value streams and processes must be in place.

Therefore, a survey of existing value flows and processes is now being made. An overall plan for this work is shown in the picture below.
Everyone who is a contributor / stakeholder gets involved in this.

Stakeholders are contacted by Sigurd and India.
Contact them for any questions / suggestions.
