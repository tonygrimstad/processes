### The Goal (Part 1 - Planning)

- ### Whatever method (s). **The goal** is to understand what is **the minimum need for tool support in current processes**
  - ### We need "Tool Support Hypotheses", to be able to do a PoC on whether e.g. GitHub may be an option (or other system/tool)
  - ### What kind of information security must be taken care of in tool support 
  - ### Tool support Across department BOD in the first place (Across Digdir when we are ready)

- ### When the first sub-goal has been achieved, a recommendation for a tool strategy is presented to the management in the BOD department.
