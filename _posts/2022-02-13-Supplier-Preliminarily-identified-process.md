#### General
The purpose of the supplier management is to ensure that all contracts with suppliers support the company's needs, and that suppliers fulfill their contractual obligations.

<br />

Supplier management needs input from the processes that use suppliers to work in their processes.
This is because Digdir / BOD must have control that deliveries and costs are in accordance with contracts.

<br />

The suppliers often have work in the Service Management processes, for work in Altinn II (not in Altinn III, since the contracts do not cover here).
